# 🗣 Chat Application

_Relying primarily on WebSockets, JWT for auth and Postgresql as my DB._

[ADD PHOTO HERE]

There's nothing to add since it's just a Real Time Chat on your browser, you can upload photos, talk and create/join rooms.

- 👎 **Downsides**:
  - Loads all images immediately after login making the **Interaction to Next Paint (INP)** be huge
  - There's some UI bugs with **Firefox engine (Gecko)**
  - Project structure is just a mess and it gets worse and worse
  - _And still counting..._

#### What went wrong:

I learnt a ton with this project, but at this point it's just tiring & frustrating to continue because of my:

- **horrible project structure** (im trying to improve that)
- **bad decision making** (caused by not knowing what i wanted)
- **the feeling of getting stuck** (i can't continue other projects cuz of this)
- and **lack of knowledge** which thats the main reason i made this in the first place.

## ℹ **Install guide:**
